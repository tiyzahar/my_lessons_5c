	<p style="text-align: center;">This is the story about the student life. It gives a moral lesson to all fun-loving students who spend their valuable time in enjoying parties, movies, etc and not serious in studies because every moment of student life is valuable and time must be utilized by the students in regular studies . Now-a-days, students think that student life is very easy and full of fun today especially college life of the students. But the future of students depend upon their achievements in student life because the fun-loving students of today used smart ways to get good marks in examination</p>

	<p>WWF's mission is to stop the <strong>degradation</strong> of our planet's natural environment.</p>
